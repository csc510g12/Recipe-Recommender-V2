## What is Recipe Recommender?

Introducing Saveurs S√©lection‚Äîthe smart solution to your cooking dilemmas! If you have ever struggled to decide what to cook then this application is just for you! Saveurs S√©lection suggests recipes based on the ingredients you already have. Our AI Chef Gemini provides smart substitutions, so you're never out of options. Need a fully customized dish? Generate complete recipes just for you.
Plus, our auto-generated grocery list simplifies shopping for any recipe you wish to cook. It is our mission to enable our users to -

### Cook smarter, save time, and enjoy stress-free meal planning.

With SSO Sign-In, logging in has never been easier or more secure‚Äînow you can access your account via social media or email with just a click. Our AI-Powered Recipe Suggestions take personalization to a new level, recommending dishes that fit your tastes and ingredients seamlessly. To make exploring recipes even more intuitive, we‚Äôve introduced Chef Gemini! - an AI Chef that offers tailored options to help you find exactly what you‚Äôre craving. And, with an Enhanced UI and Bug Fixes, browsing and saving recipes is smoother than ever.


## Basic project Flow:
![Project Flow Gif](flow-rr.gif) <br>

### Here are a few user interactions / case-studies to demonstrate how our system works:

1. User Registration and Authentication:
Users can create an account using an email and password combination or sign in through supported social media platforms such as Google or Facebook. The authentication process ensures secure access to user data while managing sessions effectively. Upon successful login, users gain access to personalized features, including bookmarked recipes, AI-powered recommendations, and profile-based preferences.

   [![User Registration Screen](/images/login_rr.png)](/images/login_rr.png) <br>

2. Smart Recipe Search:
Users can search for recipes in multiple ways. By entering a list of available ingredients, the system filters and returns relevant recipes that match the provided inputs. Alternatively, users can locate specific recipes by searching with a dish name. If no exact matches are found, Chef Gemini, the AI-powered assistant, can generate a new recipe based on the user's ingredients, dietary preferences, and cooking style, ensuring that users always have an option to cook with what they have on hand.

   [![Recipe search screen](/images/home_screen_rr.png)](/images/home_screen_rr.png) <br>
   [![Recipe generate screen](/images/ai_recipe_rr.png)](/images/ai_recipe_rr.png) <br>


3. Add a Recipe:
Users can contribute new recipes to the system by providing details such as the dish name, a list of ingredients, preparation time, cuisine type, and step-by-step instructions. Additionally, they have the option to upload an image to accompany the recipe. Once submitted, the recipe is stored in the database, making it available for search and discovery within the system.

   [![Add a new recipe screen](/images/add_recipe_rr.png)](/images/add_recipe_rr.png) <br>

4. AI-Powered Recipe Customization:
For existing recipes, users have the ability to request ingredient substitutions tailored to specific needs. Chef Gemini can modify recipes based on dietary restrictions such as gluten-free, vegan, or lactose-intolerant options. Additionally, users focused on health and fitness can request modifications to align with specific goals such as high-protein, low-carb, or keto-friendly diets. If certain ingredients are unavailable, the system provides suitable alternatives, ensuring that users can still prepare the dish with accessible substitutions.

   [![Chef Gemini Response screen](/images/chef_gemini_rr.png)](/images/chef_gemini_rr.png) <br>

5. Bookmark Recipes:
Users can save recipes for future reference by bookmarking them. All bookmarked recipes are stored within the user‚Äôs profile, allowing for quick and easy access without requiring repeated searches.

   [![Bookmark Recipes Screen](/images/bookmarks_rr.png)](/images/bookmarks_rr.png) <br>

6. User Profile & Grocery List Generation:
The user profile serves as a central hub for managing all bookmarked recipes, enabling users to review and access saved content at any time. Additionally, users can generate a grocery list based on any bookmarked recipe. The system compiles a structured shopping list by extracting the required ingredients, ensuring a seamless transition from meal planning to grocery shopping.

   [![Grocery List screen](/images/grocery_rr.png)](/images/grocery_rr.png) <br>

7. Secure Logout:
Users can securely log out of their accounts, terminating the active session and redirecting them to the landing page. Future access will require re-authentication, maintaining security and ensuring that user data remains protected.

## Support - How to contact us when you hit rock-bottom?

Common issues observed and solutions: <br>

1. Sometimes there would be vulnerabilities found in the backend, so fix it by running 'npm install nodemon --save-dev', because npm audit fix --force won't fix it.

2. The Auth0 login may occasionally experience callback errors if specific URLs aren‚Äôt specified on the application page. If you encounter this issue, ensure you add the hosting address to the allowed callback URLs </br>
